# Building Puppet Enterprise RPM packages

Puppetlabs are providing source RPMs for those part of their Puppet Enterprise stack which is under GPL license terms. This is short guide on how build the GPL packages yourself.

## Puppet Enterprise 3.1.2
* SLES 11 - all packages needed for Puppetmaster, PuppetDB, Apache+Passenger and MCollective are working. 
* SLES 10 - all packages needed for running Puppet agents are working.

## Building Instructions
* Checkout into your build environment, change into the desired version+distro directory and read the instructions in README.md.


Enjoy,
Thomas Willert
